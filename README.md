# Token Smart Contract

## Overview

This repository contains a Solidity smart contract for a token named "Premium Token" (PT). The token is based on the ERC-20 standard and extends the OpenZeppelin ERC20 implementation. The smart contract includes additional functionality, such as initialization, minting, burning, and manual transfers.
